Module 6 homework.  WeatherPy.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook which visualizes the weather of over five hundred cities worldwide.  Weather data is extracted from the OpenWeatherMap API and scatter plots of Latitude vs Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed output.  Linear regression analyses for cities in the northern and southern hemispheres are performed on Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed vs Latitude and the results briefly discussed.  This program takes about ten minutes to run and code is in Python 3.10.  Vacation.ipynb is another Jupyter notebook which creates a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame.  The size of the point is the humidity in each city.  I couldn't get the world map these points were supposed to be superimposed on.  Next, the DataFrame was narrowed down to find ideal weather conditions (maximum temperature between 21 deg C and 27 deg C, zero cloudiness and wind speed less than 4.5 m/s.  A new DataFrame called hotel_df was created with city, coordinates, humidity, country and an empty column called Hotel Name.  We were supposed to find the first hotel located within 10 000 m of those coordinates but I didn't understand exactly how the parameters worked, and could only get Geoapify to work by plugging an address, which I did for the first city in hotel_df (the Peruvian one).  I had much more success with WeatherPy.ipynb than I did with coding this program.
